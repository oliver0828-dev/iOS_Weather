# iOS_Weather

This iOS Weather app was developed as a part of my STEM Fair project, aimed at introducing students to the world of Swift and SwiftUI. The project was inspired by Sean Allen's Weather App SwiftUI Course, and I modified aspects of the UI and textures to tailor it to the specific learning objectives of the students.

## Features

- **Swift and SwiftUI:** The app is built using Swift programming language and SwiftUI framework, providing a modern and intuitive user interface.

- **Educational Purpose:** This project serves as an educational resource for teaching students about iOS app development. The step-by-step implementation, guided by a tutorial video, empowers students to grasp fundamental concepts in Swift and SwiftUI.

- **Customizations:** The UI and textures of the Weather app have been tweaked to demonstrate how developers can personalize the appearance of their applications.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the iOS_Weather app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iOS_Weather.git
    ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
    Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the `.xcodeproj` file.

3. **Build and Run:**
    Build and run the app using the Xcode simulator or connect your iOS device to see the Weather app in action.
